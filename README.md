This project applies Linear Regression to predict Apple’s (AAPL) stock closing prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance). After performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations, we engineered features including the previous day's closing price (Lag_1_Close), moving averages (MA_7, MA_30, MA_90), daily returns, and trading volume. A single linear regression model was trained on these features and evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score. The model was able to capture stock price trends effectively, showing high accuracy and strong fit with the data.
